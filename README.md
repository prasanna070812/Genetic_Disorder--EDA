# Genetic_Disorder--EDA
The problem statement of analyzing a genetic disorders dataset to identify key factors associated with the presence of specific genetic disorders and develop a predictive model follows a structured approach. Initially, we will load and understand the dataset, examining its features (columns) and identifying the target variable, which indicates the type of genetic disorder. This step involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and relationships between the features. Data preprocessing is crucial and includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing or standardizing numerical features as needed.

# Key Tasks:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.

Visualization: Created informative visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to illustrate key trends.

Analysis: Identified significant correlations and trends that contribute to a better understanding of Genetic Disorders.
